> Building a *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* (using Ethereum and Solidity)

## What is DAO?
It's a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization working towards a specific goal.
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization mainly consists of:
1. Member-owned communities without centralized leadership.
2. Collaboration in community through some sort of representation for members.
3. Committing funds for a specific use to the community, decided by the community.

## Extent of DAO
Since DAO's extend vastly in the type of decentralization aspects they bring about in their system, we choose to restrict our scope for decisions by *majority voting* on multiple proposals by users owining **DAI-MA** tokens in exchange for **ETH** tokens.
 
## DAO-MA
# Steps
1. Token buying - Users can exchange ethereum for buying one or more Dai-Ma tokens.
2. The collected ethereum will be used for funding proposals.
3. The buying period last for only 5 seconds, meaning that only users can only buy tokens within this time period, after which no tokens can be bought.
4. Once the buying period expires, the next steps are only executed if the minimum ether requirement is fulfilled.
5. If the requirement is not fulfilled then we return the ethereum for the all the users and  get back all the tokens.
6. Then a proposal with multiple organisation,  is proposed.
7. Voting phase begins, where each token holder can vote according to the number of tokens they hold.
8. Next step is to verify all the votes.
9. After the voting phase ends, the votes are are revealed.
10. After votes are revealed, the winner is decided and the ethereum mentioned in proposal is transferred to the winning organisation.
11. Now if the users want to revoke their tokens they are allowed to do so. But tokens cannot be revoked during the process.
